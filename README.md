Splunk Search-Head Access Control and Load Balancing

OpenResty: with this tool, you can set restrictions for access control for example if you want only the admin to log in to your destination with a specific IP Address. 
but why don't we use Firewall? this restriction is not based on the network. it is only based on the web requests itself.

HA-Proxy: with this tool, you can set load-balance on different load-balancing algorithms.
