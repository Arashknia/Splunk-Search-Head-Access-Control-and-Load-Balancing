# This is the scenario:

+ Clients enter: "https://\<IP-Address-of-OpenResty-Machine\>"

+ First, They will be connected to OpenResty, and it checks **Admin-Restriction-Policy** on coming requests.

+ If requests were ok with **Admin-Restriction-Policy**, OpenResty passes the request to HAproxy.

+ HAproxy balances the requests between your search heads.

# Install OpenResty

**Step 1: Prerequisites**

Before installing OpenResty, make sure that your system is up-to-date and has the required dependencies.
```
sudo yum update
sudo yum install -y gcc pcre-devel zlib-devel make unzip openssl-devel perl
systemctl disable firewalld
systemctl stop firewalld
```

**Step 2: Preparing tar package**

Now you should put the **openresty-1.27.1.1.tar.gz** in the root directory.

Run the following commands as root in the right order. üî• **Do not change the order of commands.**

```
tar -zxvf openresty-1.27.1.1.tar.gz
```

```
cd openresty-1.27.1.1
```

```
./configure -j2
```

```
make -j2
```

```
sudo make install
```

```
cd ~
```

# Configuration

**Step 1: splunk_admin_restriction.conf configuration***

Create the following directory:

```
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf/conf.d/
```

üßê Create the config file "splunk_admin_restriction.conf" by running the following command. 
```
vi /usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf/conf.d/splunk_admin_restriction.conf
```

**Step 2: Add this content to the **splunk_admin_restriction** file.**

#
***IMPORTANT HINT:*** admin policy is a regex "location ~ ^/[^/]+/account/login$" which checks the requests that have "account" and "login" within it. then if the username was "admin" and the request was coming from the IP 192.168.101.127 (which you have to change based on your choice), the admin will be able to log in. Also, Change server_name IP from 192.168.101.111 to your current server IP or current machine IP

```
# OpenResty NGINX + Lua after installing HAProxy
# ===============================================
# This config file is to satisfy both requirements

# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS (Change server_name IP from 192.168.101.111 to your current server IP or current machine IP)
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name 192.168.101.111;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

# HTTPS with Lua IP-based restriction for admin login (Change server_name IP from 192.168.101.111 to your current server IP or current machine IP)
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name 192.168.101.111;

    ssl_certificate /usr/local/openresty/nginx/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /usr/local/openresty/nginx/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.key;

    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;

    # Admin login check via Lua
    location ~ ^/[^/]+/account/login$ {
        access_by_lua_block {
            local ngx = ngx
            local cjson = require "cjson"

            if ngx.req.get_method() == "POST" then
                ngx.req.read_body()
                local args = ngx.req.get_post_args()

                local username = args["username"]
                local client_ip = ngx.var.remote_addr

                ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "Login attempt from IP: " .. client_ip .. ", username: " .. (username or "nil"))

                if username == "admin" and client_ip ~= "192.168.100.127" then
                    ngx.status = ngx.HTTP_FORBIDDEN
                    ngx.say("403 Forbidden: Admin login not allowed from this IP")
                    return ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_FORBIDDEN)
                end
            end
        }

        # Proxy to HAProxy
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    # All other requests to HAProxy
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

**Step 3: You should make a little change to nginx.conf**

Run the following command and add the following line to the config file.

```
vi /usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf/nginx.conf
```
**NOTEüßê : Do not delete anything from this config file, just add the following line**

```
include /usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf/conf.d/*.conf;
```
You can figure out where to add this line in the below Picture

# Create a self-signed certificate for a secure connection to OpenResty

Clients must be able to connect to **your current machine** via HTTPS. so just define and create a self-signed certificate by running the following commands:

```
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/openresty/nginx/ssl
```
```
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /usr/local/openresty/nginx/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /usr/local/openresty/nginx/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.crt
```

For all of them enter dot(.), except "Common Name":

+ Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]: üëÄ just enter a dot

+ State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]: üëÄ just enter a dot

+ Locality Name (eg, city) []:

+ Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:üëÄ just enter a dot

+ Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []: üëÄ just enter a dot

+ Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []: # üòè enter the IP of load balancer **\<Your Current Machine IP Address\>** 

+ Email Address: üëÄ just enter a dot

‚úÖ Now certificate has been created and your clients can connect to your current machine via HTTPS.

**Step 4: Starting OpenResty and logging configurations**

export to PATH:
```
export PATH=/usr/local/openresty/bin:$PATH
```
```
export PATH=/usr/local/openresty/bin:/usr/local/openresty/nginx/sbin:$PATH
```

Start with this command:
```
/usr/local/openresty/bin/openresty
```
or
```
openresty
```
